## Pull Request Guidelines

- **One feature per PR** - Keeps reviews focused and changes easier to understand
- **Test your changes** - Verify they work in GitHub Pages and don't break existing functionality
- **Update documentation** - If you add features, document them with examples
- **Describe your changes** - Explain what you changed and why in the PR description
- **Keep it simple** - Follow Xanthan's philosophy of simplicity and accessibility

## Code Style

### HTML/Liquid Templates
- Follow existing include patterns in `_includes/`
- Use descriptive parameter names
- Add comments explaining non-obvious functionality
- Keep includes focused on single responsibilities

### CSS
- Use CSS variables for colors, spacing, and fonts
- Comment complex selectors or non-obvious styles
- Follow the two-tier color system (named colors → semantic variables)
- Test responsive behavior on mobile and desktop

### Markdown
- Use clear headings and structure
- Include code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Provide working examples users can copy-paste
- Write in an accessible, friendly tone

### Documentation
- Write for beginners - assume no prior web development knowledge
- Explain both "what" and "why"
- Include screenshots where helpful
- Test all instructions by following them yourself

## Testing Your Changes

Before submitting a PR:
1. **Build locally** with Jekyll or Docker to catch errors
2. **Check all links** to ensure nothing is broken
3. **Test responsive design** on different screen sizes
4. **Verify examples work** by copying and pasting your own code
5. **Review the diff** to ensure only intended changes are included
